## Overview
- Create graphs to show overall outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.
- Take the outcomes of theater and plays as examples, to analyze how successful of Louise crowdfunding campaigns. According to the analyzed data, give out some recommendations to Louise.

### Advanced analysis results
- Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  1. Creating a pivot table to pull out theater outcomes data accompanied with launch date. 
  2. Drawing a line chart to show successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns of launch month dependence.

- Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  1. Caculating the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled campaignes based on crowdfunding goal amount.
  2. Creating a line chart to visualize the outcomes of plays based on campaign goals.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

 *_```=COUNTIFS```function contains several criterion, which makes the formulas very long, Especially the referenced cells are from another worksheet. One need to be careful to confirm the cell name. ```Alt+Enter``` (to input in new line)also would help to make it easier to read._

 *_When selected column has huge number of rows and the whole column needs to be selected. Keyboard shortcut ```Ctrl+â†“``` can help to scroll to the end of column. For short, we can use column name only instead. (e.g.```E2:E4115``` --> ```E:E```)_

 *_Right click is more convenient than looking for tools from the ribbons above if presence. e.g. changing the color of chart lines, formatting axis._

## Summary and Potential Questions 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  *Successful theater campaigns are more than failed theater campaigns in each month, especially during the middle of the year. 
   So theater is an efficient crwdfunding way. 
   
  *May is the best month to launch theater campaingns. 
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  
  *For plays, which campaign goals are lower than $20,000, are easy to get accomplished.
  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  
  *The cost of campaign is not included. Net goals and net pledged amount should be caculated by deducting the cost or budget.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  
  *Comparison of total crowdfunding amounts in different countries by converting all currency to US dollar```$```.
  
  *Analysis of outcomes based on daily crowedfunding amount during the campaign.
